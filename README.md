> Takes two objects that describe the structure of a database and produces the PostgreSQL statements required to get from one to the other.

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

```javascript
  const pgDiffSync = require('pg-diff-sync')
  const currentDbStructure = {...} 
  const expectedDbStructure = {...} 

  const statements = pgDiffSync(
    currentDbStructure,
    expectedDbStructure
  )  
  // Returns an array of DDL statements to apply on the PostgreSQL database

### pgDiffSync(baseDbStructure, targetDbStructure)

### Arguments:
| Arg  | Type | Notes |
| ---  | ----- | ------ |
| `baseDbStructure`  | `object`  | An object representing the original starting position of a database - most likely the output conjured from the __[pg-info](https://github.com/wmfs/pg-info)__ package |
| `targetDbStructure`  | `object`  | And an object representing how the database needs to be - in the same form as `baseDbStructure` (again see the __[pg-info](https://github.com/wmfs/pg-info)__ package for more details) |

## <a name="output"></a>Output

The output from __pg-diff-sync__ is a simple array of strings.

* Each string is a separate DDL statement, that should be run on the PostgreSQL database that produced the `baseDbStructure` object. 
* With some caveats, running these statements on the _base_ database will turn it into the _target_ database
